## Changelog

### Added

- **New Script**: `.githooks/generate_docs.sh`
  - Automates the generation of a concise changelog entry from the latest git diff.
  - Utilizes an AI API to format changes into markdown, directly adding them to the `changelog` directory with timestamps in filenames.

- **New Script**: `.githooks/lint_ai.sh`
  - Implements AI-based linting for staged changes before commit.
  - Analyzes diffs for logic, performance, or security issues using an external AI service.

### Modified

- **Updated Pre-commit Hook**: `.githooks/pre-commit`
  - Ensures required tools (`jq`, `curl`) are available.
  - Integrates calls to both the new `lint_ai.sh` and `generate_docs.sh` scripts during commit preparation, enhancing code quality checks and documentation automation.

- **New Script**: `.gihooks/prepare-commit-msg`
  - Automates the creation of concise commit messages using AI based on staged changes. Writes the generated message directly into the commit message file.

### Miscellaneous

- Updated README instructions for running the frontend in HTTPS local mode, with a tip to check the `tls` folder for configuring certificates.

These additions and modifications aim to enhance automation, improve code quality checks through AI integration, and streamline development workflows by automating documentation and commit processes.
