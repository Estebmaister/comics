  - Ensures required tools (`jq`, `curl`) are available.
  - Integrates calls to both the new `lint_ai.sh` and `generate_docs.sh` scripts during commit preparation, enhancing code quality checks and documentation automation.

- **New script**: `.githooks/prepare-commit-msg`
  - Automates the creation of concise commit messages using AI based on staged changes. Writes the generated message directly into the commit message file.

### Miscellaneous

- Updated README instructions for running the frontend in HTTPS local mode, with a tip to check the `tls` folder for configuring certificates.
